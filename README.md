# Checkers

For a while I've wanted to create a map-based javascript strategy game.  I created this checkers game as a proof of concept to test how well a JS web map library (<a href="https://maptalks.org/" target="_blank">MapTalks</a> in this case) would work as the basis of a game framework.

Right now the game doesn't force jumps (I never liked that rule - it'll stay that way!), allow for multiple jumps in one turn (I plan to add that eventually...), or have AI.

The nNotifications were created using <a href="https://github.com/jaredreich/notie" target="_blank">Notie</a>.
